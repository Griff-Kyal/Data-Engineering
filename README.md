# ⚙️ Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my Data Engineering portfolio!  
This repository showcases projects I’m currently building (and future ones planned) that focus on **data pipelines, ETL processes, database design, and scalable data infrastructure**.  

My goal is to work through all the **core practices of modern data engineering**, from ingestion to transformation, storage, orchestration, and reporting.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

- **Programming & Scripting**: Python (Pandas, PySpark, NumPy), SQL, Bash
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Cloud Storage (AWS S3 / Azure Blob)
- **ETL / Data Processing**: Pandas, PySpark, dbt (Data Build Tool)
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Prefect
- **Data Modeling**: Star Schema, Snowflake Schema, Dimensional Modeling
- **Visualization / Reporting**: Power BI, Metabase
- **Other Tools**: Git/GitHub, Docker, Jupyter Notebook
